# SPLxUTSPAN2026-Senmo-Sloths
Our approach to the SPLxUTSPAN 2026 challenge began with a bottom-up approach to handling the problem. Independent of what techniques, models, algorithms, or feature extraction came up with the best performance, this was fundamentally a problem of biomechanics. Given the release point, velocity, and position, a simple calculation using a projectile motion formula would yield a precise outcome under ideal conditions. However, this problem is unique in the fact that the conditions are far from ideal; data is noisy and unreliable, and small changes in initial conditions, like spin and air resistance, are propagated and even amplified into the outcome of the shot.

Therefore, we began by analyzing this as a biomechanics problem and progressively improving upon our techniques to account for the nuance of this competition. Shooting a basketball is a relatively consistent movement, and, despite differences in form, an algorithmic approach can easily detect the location of when a shot took place. By making a window around the peak height of the hand, and then locating the peak velocity in the forward and upwards direction, we can have a very reliable assessment as to when the ball must have left the player’s hands. This allows us to account for differences between trials as to when the shot takes place, and serves as an excellent starting point.

Generalizable model: The first ML solution was a “PhysicsNet” approach (calculate launch parameters and perform projectile motion), designed to be generalizable by taking a short time window of the pose and hand kinematics around the shot. This was fed into a Transformer sequence model to predict the ball's launch parameters: speed, vertical launch, azimuth, and a small, learned, offset from the shooting hand (mirror augmentation allows it work with left-handed individuals). The predicted release point and velocity are then passed through a simple projectile-physics layer to compute the expected intersection when approaching the rim. It then uses the loss from the calculated angle, depth, and left/right to update and train the model. The model uses a GRL alongside participant ID (PID) to "unlearn" participant-level features, making it exquisitely generalizable by learning global patterns for determining the shot. When performing a leave-one-participant-out validation, this model got an MSE of 0.012 and performed similarly on the leaderboard (0.010; see other submission). This performance highlights this model’s unique characteristic of performing similarly between individuals it was trained on, as well as those it had never seen.

We then entered an exploratory phase of investigating different approaches in the literature that could possibly improve our scores. We built upon the “PhysicsNet” approach by building MLPs and RNN’s to calculate these release parameters or residuals. In a “DirectNet” approach (having the model directly predict the endpoint), we tried many other model families including various trees, CNNs, ResNETs, TCNs, etc. We then incorporated different design patterns to improve the model, like MAML weight initialization, Fourier features, PCA, model stacking and ensembling, and mixture of experts. We also accounted for different input feature techniques, shot windows, and outputs. This gave us a foundation as to the best techniques and combinations for building a robust model.

Individualized model: However, this is a competition, and our goal is to optimize as per the competition criteria; train on data from five individuals, and then test on more data from the same five individuals. Our final pipeline allows for participant-specific style by having a per-participant mean baseline and a way to include features and biases for each participant. When plotting the angle, depth, and left/right, we found a broad standard deviation, which significantly tightened up within each participant. Thus, this model captures the tendencies some participants may have (e.g., a participant may have a bias to shoot to the right or consistently shoot too deep) and uses them, and the PID, as a feature. The model combines these features with the linear component per-joint 3D positions (and higher derivatives like velocity and acceleration) and is then fed into a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the input. The specific model that we found had the best performance was tree-based models (ExtraTrees and RandomForest) in a “DirectNet” configuration. To further fine-tune our predictions, we use multiple random seeds for each model and employ an ensemble architecture. As opposed to the traditional approach of taking the average of each model, we employ a meta-learner (Ridge regression) that learns how to weigh each model in the final prediction. This allows us to try numerous models, architectures, and seeds, while optimizing towards the best configurations.

In this work, we developed both a highly generalizable “PhysicsNet” model and an individualized participant-specific “DirectNet” model for predicting basketball shot outcomes. To optimize performance under the competition criteria, we submitted the individualized model, as it minimized leaderboard error by leveraging player-specific patterns. However, leaderboard optimization does not necessarily reflect real-world deployment constraints. In practice, top competition models, especially highly individualized ones, would likely require adaptation to remain robust outside the controlled evaluation setting. A more realistic real-world system would combine both approaches: beginning with our generalized model for new players and transitioning to an individualized model once sufficient personal shot data has been collected. This can be further built upon with a Kalman filtering framework to integrate predictions of both models alongside real ball motion data, to get the most optimized prediction for every individual shot. Additionally, enforcing a biomechanical skeleton during motion-capture preprocessing could reduce noise and drift while enabling automatic player identification via segment-length features. Together, these techniques form the foundation of a scalable, accurate, and practically deployable shot-prediction system suitable for real-world implementation at MLSE.
