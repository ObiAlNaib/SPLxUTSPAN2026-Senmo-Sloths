# SPLxUTSPAN2026-Senmo-Sloths
Our approach to the SPLxUTSPAN 2026 challenge began with a bottom-up approach to handling the problem. Independent of what techniques, models, algorithms, or feature extraction came up with the best performance, this was fundamentally a problem of biomechanics. Given the release position, linear/angular velocities, and position, a simple calculation using a projectile motion formula would yield a precise outcome under ideal conditions. However, this problem is unique in the fact that the conditions are far from ideal; data is noisy and unreliable, and small changes in initial conditions are propagated and even amplified into the outcome of the shot.

Therefore, we began with analyzing this as a biomechanics problem and progressively improving upon our techniques to account for the nuance of this competition. Shooting a basketball is a relatively consistent movement and, despite differences in form, an algorithmic approach can easily detect the location of when a shot took place. By making a window around the peak height of the hand, and then locating the peak velocity in the forwards and upwards direction, we can have a very reliable assessment as to when the ball, must have left the player’s hands. This allows us to account for differences between trials as to when the shot takes place, and serves as an excellent starting point.

Generalizable model: The first ML solution was a physics-based approach, designed to be generalizable by taking a short time window of the pose and hand kinematics around the shot. This was fed into a Transformer sequence model to predict the ball's launch parameters: speed, vertical launch, azimuth, and a small, learned, offset from the shooting hand (mirror augmentation allows it work with left-handed individuals). The predicted release point and velocity are then passed through a simple projectile-physics layer to compute the expected intersection when approaching the rim. It then uses the loss from the calculated angle, depth, and left/right to update and train the model. The model uses a GRL alongside participant ID (PID), to "unlearn" participant level features, making it exquisitely generalizable by learning global patterns for determining the shot. When performing a leave-one-participant-out validation, this model got an MSE of 0.012 and performed similarly on the leaderboard (0.010; see other submission),. This performance highlights this model’s unique characteristic of performing similarly between individuals it was trained on, as well as those it had never seen.

We then entered an exploratory phase of investigating different approaches in literature that could possibly improve our scores. We built upon the first approach by building MLP’s and RNN’s to calculate these release parameters or residuals. In a K-fold cross validation we tried many other models including various trees, CNN’s, and ResNET’s, TCN’s, etc. We then incorporated different design patterns to improve the model like MAML weight initialization, Fourier features, PCA, model stacking and ensembling, and mixture of experts. We also accounted for different input feature techniques, shot windows, and outputs.

Individualized model: However, this is a competition, and our goal is to optimize as per the competition criteria; train on data from five individuals, and then test on more data from the same five individuals. Our final pipeline allows for participant-specific style by having a per-participant mean baseline and a way to include features and biases for each participant. Thus, this model captures the tendencies some participants may have, for example, a participant may have a bias to shoot to the right or consistently shoot too deep. We also give the model a clear indicator of which participant took which shot, thus the model can learn the different patterns for different participants. We also estimate the moment of release by finding when the shooting wrist has its biggest speed burst late in the motion, and we take extra features from a short window around that moment. The model also uses the linear component velocities per-joint 3D velocities (and higher derivatives like velocity and acceleration) for key joints. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is also used to compress this large raw motion data set into a smaller set of main movement patterns. We train several tree-based models (ExtraTrees and RandomForest) with different random seeds and average their predictions. Then we use a simple “combiner” model (Ridge regression) that learns how much to trust each model’s prediction, producing one final prediction for each target.

In this work, we developed both a highly generalizable physics-informed model and an individualized participant-specific model for predicting basketball shot outcomes. To optimize performance under the competition criteria, we submitted the individualized model, as it minimized leaderboard error by leveraging player-specific patterns. However, leaderboard optimization does not necessarily reflect real-world deployment constraints. In practice, top competition models, especially highly individualized ones, would likely require adaptation to remain robust outside the controlled evaluation setting. A more realistic real-world system would combine both approaches: beginning with our generalized model for new players and transitioning to an individualized model once sufficient personal shot data has been collected. This can be further built upon with a Kalman filtering framework to integrate predictions of both models along-side real ball motion data, to get the most optimized prediction for every individual shot. Additionally, enforcing a biomechanical skeleton during motion-capture preprocessing could reduce noise and drift while enabling automatic player identification via segment-length features. Together, these techniques form the foundation of a scalable, accurate, and practically deployable shot-prediction system suitable for real-world implementation at MLSE.
